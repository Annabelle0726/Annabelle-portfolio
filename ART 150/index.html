    <h3>The Great Wall</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">The Great Wall holds a very special place in my heart as a symbol of China's history,
            culture and national identity. The Great Wall of China is one of the most notorious structures in the entire
            world.
            The Jinshanling section in Hebei Province, China, pictured here, is only a small part of the wall that
            stretches over 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles).
            <br>
            Around 220 B.C.E., Qin Shi Huang, also called the First Emperor, united China. He masterminded the process
            of uniting the existing walls into one. At that time, rammed earth and wood made up most of the wall.
            Emperor after emperor strengthened and extended the wall, often with the aim of keeping out the northern
            invaders. In some places, the wall was constructed of brick.
            Elsewhere, quarried granite or even marble blocks were used. The wall was continuously brought up to date as
            building techniques advanced.
            <br>
            As the largest man-made structure in history, it represents the strength
            and resilience of the Chinese people. Walking along the ancient stones,
            I could feel the profound connection to the countless generations who built and guarded this wonder.

        <h4>
            Southern Song Landscape Painting
        </h4>
        <article>
            In the Southern Song period (1127-1279), after the capital
            was relocated to Hangzhou because of the loss of Kaifeng and most of north China
            to the Jurchen Jin dynasty, court painters continued to paint landscapes,
            but favored small formats and more lyrical treatments.
            Below is one such large album leaf by the court painter
            Ma Yuan (active 1190-1224). Note the poetic couplet the painter
            inscribed on this painting. By this time, painters were frequently exploiting
            the connections between poetry and painting, either by making a painting
            to capture poetic lines or writing a new poem to bring out features of a painting they had done.

                        Ma Yuan's "On a Mountain Path in Spring," a renowned painting from the Song dynasty.
                        The presence of a relatively large human figure in this artwork significantly impacts how we
                        view it.
                        The size of the human figure, in relation to the surrounding landscape, draws our attention
                        and creates a focal point within the composition.
                        <br>
                        It allows us to connect with the human presence and evokes a sense of scale and perspective.
                        By including a sizable human figure, Ma Yuan emphasizes the relationship between humanity and
                        nature.
                        The viewer is invited to imagine themselves in the shoes of the figure, experiencing the
                        serenity
                        and beauty of the mountain path in spring. This aspect adds a contemplative and introspective
                        element to the painting, deepening our appreciation for the natural world and our place within
                        it.
                        <br>
                        Ma Yuan's delicate brushwork,
                        subtle use of color, and the tranquil atmosphere all contribute to a sense
                        of harmony and serenity. The painting captures a fleeting moment in time,
                        invoking a feeling of tranquility and immersion in nature. The composition invites
                        contemplation and introspection, encouraging viewers to appreciate the
                        beauty of the natural world and find solace in its peaceful embrace.
                        Thus, one could perceive the composition
                        as poetic in its ability to evoke emotions and inspire a sense of connection with nature.</p>

                    <p class="card-text collapse" id="collapse2">
                        Xia Gui, a prominent artist during the Southern Song dynasty,
                        made significant contributions to the court landscape painting tradition.
                        <br>
                        When observing the brushwork in Xia Gui's painting,
                        one can notice its remarkable finesse and precision.
                        Xia Gui employed a delicate and controlled brush technique, utilizing varying ink tones
                        and brushstrokes to create a sense of depth and texture.
                        The brushwork in "Pure and Remote Views of Mountains and Streams" is characterized by
                        its rhythmic and fluid quality, reflecting Xia Gui's mastery in capturing the essence of
                        the natural landscape.
                        <br>
                        As for the fact that this painting was executed on paper, it plays a crucial role in
                        shaping the overall impression it makes.
                        The use of paper as a medium allows for a certain level of absorbency,
                        which affects how the ink interacts with the surface.
                        <br>
                        Additionally, the size of the scroll is noteworthy.
                        Being unusually tall for a handscroll, with a height of almost twenty inches,
                        it offers a grander and more expansive view of the landscape.
                        The tall format allows for a vertical reading experience,
                        enabling the viewer to appreciate the verticality of the mountains and the flowing streams
                        in a more immersive manner.

                        Overall, Xia Gui's brushwork, combined with the use of paper as the medium, contributes to the
                        evocative and poetic nature of "Pure and Remote Views of Mountains and Streams." The meticulous
                        brushwork and the choice of paper enhance the painting's impression of tranquility, capturing
                        the essence of the natural world in a way that invites contemplation and appreciation.

                Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 animated film Spirited Away has enthralled
                audiences worldwide with its whimsical yet poignant storytelling.
                Set in a mysterious spirit world parallel to our own, the film follows a young
                girl named Chihiro who must work in a bathhouse for spirits to save her parents
                and find her way home. Through its fantastical narrative, Spirited Away offers
                glimpses into Japanese cultural traditions and impart meaningful life lessons.

            </p>
            <p>
                On asymbolic level, the bathhouse itself represents Japanese communal bathing culture. As a place where
                varied
                spirits socialize, it embodies Japan's philosophy of harmonious co-existence. The meticulous details
                depicting
                food, clothing, architecture and customs also transport viewers into pre-modern Japanese aesthetic. More
                profoundly, Chihiro's own hero's journey symbolizes humanity's capacity for courage and transformation
                when
                facing adversity. Her character development highlights virtues of perseverance,
                empathy and drawing inner strength from community - values deeply ingrained in Japanese philosophy.

        <h4>NARUTO<small>A Iconic Tale of Passion and Perseverance</small></h4>
        <article class="row">
            <div class="col-6">
                Created by Masashi Kishimoto, the Naruto anime and manga series broke popularity records during its
                2002-2017 run. Centered around a hyperactive young ninja named Naruto Uzumaki, the coming-of-age story
                follows his efforts to graduate from the Ninja Academy and ultimately become the title character, the
                Hokage, the leader of his village. Its immense success globalized Japanese manga and anime by
                introducing the ninja motif and life of a shinobi to new audiences.
            </div>
            <iframe class="col-6" width="560" height="315"
                    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QczGoCmX-pI?si=-Z_R6kJy_EyECwHr" title="YouTube video player"
                    frameborder="0"
                    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                    allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <div class="col-6">Beyond surface level ninja action-adventure, Naruto subverts typical tropes to impart
                meaningful lessons about social themes. As an ostracized child due to having a nine-tailed fox spirit
                inside him, Naruto faces prejudice but overcomes this through developing friendships. His determination
                to never give up despite failures symbolizes persevering despite obstacles, whether institutional
                injustice or personal shortcomings. His rivalry with Sasuke also explores the complexities of
                friendship, redemption, and moral dilemmas of choosing between one's duty and personal desires.
                <br>
                As the story evolves, Naruto matures from a delinquent prankster to a leader inspiring hope for peaceful
                coexistence. His ability to acknowledge others' perspectives and bring out the good in people even from
                the most troubled backgrounds upholds compassion and social cohesion as core Japanese values. In this
                way, Kishimoto's magnum opus does more than entertain - it leaves thought-provoking messages about
                cultivating understanding and strengthening community bonds that have enduring relevance even beyond its
                fictional world. Through its globally recognized characters, Naruto spreads inspiration as one of
                Japan's most influential cultural ambassadors.

    <h3>
        Exploring the Diversity of Asian Art and Culture
    </h3>
    <p>
        Across Asia, diverse artforms provide gateways to understanding rich cultural traditions.
        Iconic sites like the Great Wall of China showcase historical and engineering achievements
        maintained over centuries.
        As the largest ancient structure, it attracts global visitors to
        experience Chinese cultural heritage and resilience through time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Traditional Chinese landscape painting exemplifies intricate artistic mastery through subtle brushwork.
        Beyond
        visual beauty, these scrolls impart philosophical perspectives on appreciating nature congruent with
        different
        imperial eras. Meticulous techniques convey cultural nuances through symbolic details.
    </p>
    <p> Meanwhile, popular cultural exports like Japanese animation and Korean
        dramas introduce global audiences to foreign societies in enjoyable ways.
        Works like Spirited Away showcase creative storytelling while imparting
        universal moral lessons. They normalize foreign cultures and build cross-cultural
        connections among worldwide fans.</p>
    <p> Engaging with Asian art in its manifold forms cultivates deeper understanding of regional histories,
        aesthetics
        and social Zeitgeists. Iconic sites, fine arts, and mass media respectively underscore traditions,
        techniques,
        and messages propagated across eras and borders. Appreciating diverse cultural productions fosters shared
        recognition for humanity's accomplishments within
        and throughout Asian civilizations. Continued exploration of varied artforms promises new insights into the
        immense richness of perspectives and experiences across the Asian continent.
